                        <p><strong><u>Use:</u> <u> </u></strong><br>
                            Connectives join two clauses, and show the relationship between them.<br>
                            The relationship can show:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>a contrast </strong>Although, but, even though, however, despite, in spite of
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>a cause </strong>because, because of, as a result of, due to </li>
                            <li><strong>an effect</strong> so, consequently, as a result, thus, therefore</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These words cannot be used interchangeably. They may be located in different places with in
                            the sentence, and they may use a different grammar.</p>
                        <p><strong><u>Form:</u></strong><br>
                            <strong>a) Connectives showing Contrast</strong><br>
                            Compare these sentences with the same meaning:
                        </p>
                        <p>i <em>It is sunny <strong>but</strong> temperatures are low.</em></p>
                        <p>Never start a sentence with <strong>But</strong>. You can use <strong>but</strong> after a
                            comma(,). In short sentences, no punctuation is needed.</p>
                        <p>ii <strong><em>Although</em></strong><em> it is sunny, temperatures are low. / <strong>Even
                                    though</strong> it is sunny, temperatures are low.</em></p>
                        <p>Note how <strong>Although</strong> and <strong>Even though</strong> are located in a
                            different part of the sentence from But. <strong>Although</strong> and <strong>Even
                                though</strong> go before the known clause, whereas <strong>but</strong> goes before the
                            unknown clause. The two clauses are separated with a comma. The order of clauses can be
                            reversed.<br>
                            <br>
                            <em>Temperatures are low, <strong>even though / although</strong> it’s sunny.</em>
                        </p>
                        <p>iii <em>It is sunny. <strong>However</strong>, temperatures are low.</em></p>
                        <p>Note how <strong>however</strong> starts a sentence and is followed by a comma. It may also
                            be seen after a semi-colon (;). Consequently, it is usually seen in longer sentences.</p>
                        <p>iv <strong><em>Despite the sun</em></strong><em>, temperatures are low.</em><br>
                            <strong><em>In spite of the sun</em></strong><em>, temperatures are low.</em>
                        </p>
                        <p>Note the position of <strong>Despite</strong> and <strong>In spite of</strong> before the
                            known clause. The order of clauses can be reversed:<br>
                            <em> Temperatures are low <strong>despite / in spite of</strong> the sun.</em>
                        </p>
                        <p>Also note that these words are followed by a noun, not a verb clause. You can also use the
                            <strong>–ing</strong> form of the verb in these sentences.</p>
                        <p><strong><em>Despite&nbsp; / In spite of it being</em></strong><em> sunny, temperatures are
                                low.</em></p>
                        <p><strong>b) Connectives showing a Cause</strong><br>
                            Compare these sentences with the same meaning.</p>
                        <p>i <em>I arrived late <strong>because</strong> the traffic was bad.</em><br>
                            <strong><em>Because</em></strong><em> the traffic was bad, I arrived late.</em>
                        </p>
                        <p>Note you can ONLY start a sentence with <strong>Because</strong> if there are two clauses in
                            the sentence.<br>
                            <br>
                            <em><s>Because we were late.</s></em> INCORRECT<br>
                            <em>Because we were late, we missed the start of the show.</em><strong> </strong>CORRECT
                        </p>
                        <p>Starting a sentence with <strong>Because</strong> is more formal than using it in the middle
                            of a sentence, and is most commonly used in writing, not speaking. </p>
                        <p>ii <em>I arrived late <strong>because of</strong> the bad traffic.</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;OR
                            <strong><em>Because of</em></strong><em> the bad traffic, I arrived late.</em><br>
                            <em>I arrived late <strong>due to</strong> the bad traffic.&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OR <strong><em>Due to </em></strong><em>the bad traffic, I arrived
                                late.</em><br>
                            <em>I arrived late as <strong>a result of</strong> the bad traffic.</em> OR <strong><em>As a
                                    result of</em></strong><em> the bad traffic, I arrived late.</em>
                        </p>
                        <p>Note how these expressions are followed by a noun, not a verb clause.</p>
                        <p><strong>c) Connectives showing Effect</strong><br>
                            Compare these sentences with the same meaning.</p>
                        <p>i <em>We were late <strong>so</strong> we missed the beginning of the show.</em></p>
                        <p>Never start a sentence with <strong>So</strong>. <strong>So </strong>can follow a comma(,).
                            In short sentences, no punctuation is needed.</p>
                        <p>ii <em>We were late and <strong>thus</strong> we missed the beginning of the show.</em><br>
                            <em>We were late and <strong>consequently</strong> we missed the beginning of the
                                show.</em><br>
                            <em>We were late and <strong>as a result</strong> we missed the beginning of the
                                show.</em><br>
                            <em>We were late and <strong>therefore </strong>we missed the beginning of the show.</em>
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Consequently, As a result, Therefore</strong> and <strong>Thus</strong> are more
                            formal than <strong>So</strong>. They are common in formal sentences. They often start a
                            sentence, but they can be joined to the previous sentence with <strong>and</strong>.</p>
                        <p><strong><u>Common Mistakes:</u></strong><br>
                            1. Some students begin sentences with <strong>But</strong> and <strong>So</strong>.<br>
                            <s>Joe went to university. But he didn’t like it.</s> → Joe went to university, but he
                            didn’t like it.<br>
                            2. Some students write a sentence with because and only one clause.<br>
                            <s>I went to the shop. Because I needed some bread.</s> → I went to the shop because I
                            needed some bread.<br>
                            3. Some students do not use nouns when they needed to.<br>
                            <s>I went indoors due to it was cold outside.</s> → I went indoors due to the cold weather
                            outside.
